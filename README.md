<details> <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself game development with a dream to build my own game, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Rust. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. For me, programming has never been "simply a job," but rather a stimulating challenge that has allowed me to keep learning and developing. What began as a simple productivity solution has developed into a full-fledged passion that only grows more thrilling each time.
